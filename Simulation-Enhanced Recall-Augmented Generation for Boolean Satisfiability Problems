Simulation-Enhanced Recall-Augmented Generation for Boolean Satisfiability Problems
Abstract: This paper introduces SimRecAG, a novel approach to the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) that combines transformer-based memory mechanisms with quantum-inspired simulation techniques. Rather than relying on actual quantum hardware, we leverage quantum simulation through frameworks like PennyLane and JAX to efficiently explore solution spaces while maintaining complete classical implementability. By representing SAT instances in a vectorized memory space and using simulated quantum circuits to explore solution spaces in parallel, our approach offers advantages over traditional solvers. We present the theoretical foundations of SimRecAG, its implementation architecture, and preliminary performance evaluations on benchmark SAT instances. Results suggest that SimRecAG can identify solution patterns more efficiently than traditional SAT solvers for structured problem instances, potentially creating a new paradigm for solving NP-complete problems without requiring quantum hardware or polynomial-time solutions to all instances.

1. Introduction
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) represents the canonical NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory [1]. While significant advances have been made in practical SAT solving with algorithms like DPLL [2] and CDCL [3], the fundamental challenge of exponential worst-case complexity remains unresolved. Machine learning approaches have recently shown promise in guiding search heuristics [4, 5], but have not fundamentally altered the computational paradigm.
Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential avenue for accelerating certain computational tasks [6, 7], including SAT. However, current quantum hardware remains limited by noise, decoherence, and scalability challenges. This has led to increased interest in quantum-inspired algorithms that capture some of the computational advantages of quantum systems while remaining classically implementable [8, 9].
This paper introduces Simulation-Enhanced Recall-Augmented Generation (SimRecAG), a framework that leverages transformer-based memory mechanisms and quantum-inspired simulation techniques to attack SAT problems from a novel perspective. The key intuition behind our approach is that many practical SAT instances contain structural patterns that, if recognized and exploited, can lead to more efficient solution strategies than naive search.
Rather than compressing SAT instances (which would contradict known complexity-theoretic results [10]), SimRecAG employs vectorized representations to map problem structures to solution strategies, using quantum simulation to efficiently explore multiple solution paths simultaneously while remaining fully classical in implementation.
2. Background
2.1 Boolean Satisfiability Problem
The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) involves determining whether a given Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) has an assignment of variables that makes the formula evaluate to true. Formally, a CNF formula consists of a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or their negations).
A formula is satisfiable if there exists at least one assignment of truth values to its variables that makes the entire formula evaluate to true. SAT was the first problem proven to be NP-complete by Cook [1], establishing that any problem in NP can be reduced to SAT in polynomial time.
2.2 Classical SAT Solving Approaches
Modern SAT solvers typically employ variants of the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm [3], which enhances the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) backtracking search [2] with conflict analysis, non-chronological backtracking, and learned clauses. These methods have proven remarkably effective for many practical instances despite the theoretical worst-case complexity.
Recent work has incorporated machine learning techniques to improve variable selection heuristics [4, 5], clause deletion policies [11], and restart strategies [12]. However, these approaches still operate within the paradigm of search-based algorithms.
2.3 Quantum-Inspired Computing
Quantum-inspired algorithms seek to capture the computational advantages of quantum computing within classical frameworks. These approaches typically:
Simulate Quantum Superposition: Represent multiple states simultaneously by maintaining probability distributions.
Mimic Quantum Parallelism: Explore multiple solution paths concurrently through efficient vectorized operations.
Apply Quantum-Like Transformations: Use mathematical operations analogous to quantum gates.
These techniques have shown promise in areas such as optimization [8], machine learning [9], and sampling [13], often providing advantages over traditional classical algorithms without requiring quantum hardware.
2.4 Recall-Augmented Generation
Recall-Augmented Generation (RecAG) enhances generative AI models by incorporating internal memory mechanisms rather than external retrieval [14]. In contrast to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [15], which queries external document stores, RecAG focuses on structured internal memory of past interactions and knowledge.
3. Simulation-Enhanced Recall-Augmented Generation
3.1 Conceptual Framework
SimRecAG combines three key components:
Vectorized SAT Representation: Transforms SAT instances into vector embeddings that capture structural properties.
Transformer-Based Memory: Stores and retrieves patterns from previously solved SAT instances.
Quantum-Inspired Simulation: Uses JAX and PennyLane to simulate quantum-like exploration of solution spaces.
Unlike traditional approaches that attempt to solve each SAT instance independently, SimRecAG leverages learned patterns from previously solved instances to guide simulation-based solution strategies.
3.2 Vector Representation of SAT Instances
We represent SAT instances as vectors in a high-dimensional space where similar problems have similar representations. This vectorization process involves:
Clause Structure Encoding: We encode the graph structure of the SAT instance, where variables are nodes and clauses create edges between variables they contain.
Variable Interaction Patterns: We capture how variables interact across clauses using graph neural networks.
Solution Pattern Embeddings: We learn embeddings that encode typical solution strategies for different structural patterns.
These vector representations serve two purposes: they allow the transformer to identify similar previously-solved problems, and they provide a basis for initializing simulation parameters.
3.3 Transformer-Based Memory Architecture
The memory component employs a transformer architecture with several modifications:
Structured Memory Storage: Instead of storing raw problem instances, we store vectorized representations of problem structures paired with their solution strategies.
Similarity-Based Retrieval: We implement efficient nearest-neighbor search to identify structurally similar problems.
Forced Recall Mechanism: The model explicitly recalls and applies relevant solution patterns when constructing new solutions.
This component acts as the bridge between pattern recognition and simulation-based solution exploration.
3.4 Quantum-Inspired Simulation
Instead of using actual quantum hardware, we simulate quantum-like properties using classical computation:
State Vector Simulation: We maintain probability distributions over possible variable assignments, analogous to quantum state vectors.
Parallel State Exploration: We use vectorized operations in JAX to efficiently update and manipulate these distributions.
Simulated Quantum Operators: We implement transformations inspired by quantum gates that can explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.
This simulation approach captures many of the computational advantages of quantum computing while remaining fully classical and immediately implementable.
3.5 Integration with JAX and PennyLane
We implement our system using:
JAX: Provides efficient automatic differentiation, vectorization, and JIT compilation for high-performance tensor operations.
PennyLane: Used in simulation mode to implement quantum-inspired circuits without requiring quantum hardware.
This integration allows for end-to-end optimization of the entire pipeline, from vector representation to simulation execution, while maintaining classical implementability.

Struggles with completely random instances where structural patterns are absent.
These results suggest that SimRecAG is particularly effective for domains where SAT instances exhibit structural regularities that can be learned and exploited.
